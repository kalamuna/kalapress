// ++++++++++ Full width ratio setter

// LIMITATION: only for use in an element that is 100% of the width of the viewport

// Use this on a pseudo element that is within a flex layout to set a minumum height
// that is a percentage of the width to emulate an image ratio

// The main reason for this approach rather than applying a min height
// to the element directly is to allow for a maximum height on larger screens
